# Running BeaconKit with Kurtosis

## What is Kurtosis

[Kurtosis](https://www.kurtosis.com/) is a platform for running distributed
systems on Docker / Kubernetes. It provides a simple, powerful framework for
spinning up and tearing down distributed systems programmatically.

## How to Use

To use BeaconKit with Kurtosis, you'll first need to install the Kurtosis CLI
and its dependencies. You can find instructions for doing so
[here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install).

### Docker/local environment

Once you've installed the Kurtosis CLI, you can use it to spin up a Beacon
network with the following command from within the root directory of the
beacon-kit repo:

```bash
make start-devnet
```

This will automatically build your beacond docker image from the local source
code, and spin up a Kurtosis network based on the config file in
`kurtosis/beaconkit-all.yaml`. Once complete, this will output all the
network information for your nodes like so:

![Example Network](./img/example-network.png)

When you want to tear down your network, you can do so
with the following commands:

```bash
make stop-devnet
make rm-devnet
```

And that's it!
